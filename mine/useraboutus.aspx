                <span style="font-size: 17px" >
                Since our inception in 1985, we’ve pursued two ambitious goals: working for 
                social change and running a successful business.</span></td>

                <h2 style="color: #FF3300; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Our Activism</h2>
                <span style="font-size: 17px">
                We fight hard to enact progressive change and defeat regressive policies.</span></td>
            <td class="style7">
                <h2 style="color: #FF3300; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Our Donations</h2>
                <span style="font-size: 17px">
                From the outset, we’ve made generosity central to our business.</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="style8">
                It’s always been a tall order, but we’ve excelled at both goals through a clear 
                and sustained focus, a steady and disciplined operation, and by being adept and 
                agile when the situation demanded it. We always work hard to provide excellent 
                phones and service, and we also work hard—and yes, fight—for progressive social 
                change. We strive to make it easy for progressive individuals to make a 
                difference, and we raise millions of dollars for nonprofit groups that do the 
                same. Our social change work has always been the heart of our enterprise.</td>
            <td class="style7">
                We do so by making it easy for our members’ voices to be heard—through phone 
                calls and letters—in the halls of power. And we fight through our Polycom Action 
                network of 3 million activists, sending millions of signed petitions, emails and 
                calls to decision-makers. We also carry out ground campaigns with committed 
                volunteers when we see an opportunity to have an impact. We aim to push the 
                limits of what is possible and expand the public discourse beyond the narrow 
                boundaries of the pundits and the politicians, providing a progressive flank to 
                many campaigns.</td>
            <td class="style7">
                A percentage of our customers’ charges are sent to progressive nonprofit groups 
                that work on a range of issues: women’s rights, the environment, equality, peace 
                and social justice. Our members and activist friends help us pick the groups 
                each year and vote on how to distribute the donations among them. Since 1985, 
                we’ve raised more than $76 million for such groups. In 2013 alone, we raised 
                more than $2.6 million.</td>
